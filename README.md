# hello-world

Welcome visitor!

Here can some of my projects be found that I would like to share. 

I am an electrical engineer and like to play around with new electronics, programming languages etc. 

Github is a great platform for sharing some of my projects. However, it is not suprisingly different than subversion. Just with local copies.
